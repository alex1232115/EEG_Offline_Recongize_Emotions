<h2> EEG Offline Recongize Emotions System
  Final project for my bachelor's degree
</h2>

<h3>Configurations:</h3>
1. DEAP and SEED datasets  
2. Preprocessed methods like downsampling, low-pass filter and etc
3. Bandpower, spectral density were used for feature extractions in DEAP system; Entropy and wavelet energy in SEED system
4. Arousal, valence and James Russell's model for emotion recognition in DEAP system; pre-set labels from developers in SEED system
5. SVM, Random Forest and KNN methods for classification and emotion recognition in DEAP system; only SVM in SEED system

<h3>ðŸ“šLibraries</h3>
1. Matplotlib
2. Pandas
3. NumPy
4. Scikit-learn
5. Seaborn
